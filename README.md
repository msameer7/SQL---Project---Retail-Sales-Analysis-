# SQL---Project---Retail-Sales-Analysis-
This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. This project focuses on creating a retail sales database, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and using SQL queries to address targeted business questions. It serves as a great starting point for beginners in data analysis looking to strengthen their SQL skills.



## Objectives of the Project
Retail Sales Database Setup: Design and populate a retail sales database using the given sales dataset.

Data Cleaning: Detect and eliminate records containing null or missing values to ensure data accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct initial data exploration to gain a clear understanding of the dataset’s structure and trends.

Business Insight Generation: Leverage SQL queries to respond to key business questions and extract actionable insights from the sales data.

## Step 1. Database Setup

Database Creation: Initiated the project by creating a database named p1_retail_db.

Table Design: Constructed a table called retail_sales to store transaction-level data. Key columns include transaction ID, sale date and time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, unit price, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

## Step 2: Looking at the Data & Cleaning It
Count Records: Checked how many total rows (records) are in the dataset.

Count Customers: Found out how many different customers made purchases.

List Categories: Listed all the different product categories.

Fix Missing Data: This Dataset doesn't contain any missing values.

## Step 3: Finding Answers with SQL
Check a Day’s Sales: Got all sales made on 2022-11-05.

Find Big Orders: Found sales in the ‘Clothing’ category where more than 4 items were sold in November 2022.

More Questions: Asked more questions using SQL to learn about customers, sales patterns, and big purchases.

## Step 4: What We Learned
Customer Info: Customers were from many age groups and liked products like Clothing and Beauty.

Big Purchases: Some people spent more than 1000 in one order.

Sales by Month: Sales changed each month, showing busy and slow times.

Top Customers & Products: Found the best customers and the most popular product types.

## Step 5: Reports Made
Sales Summary: Showed total sales, customer types, and which categories sold best.

Sales Over Time: Looked at how sales changed by month and work shift.

Customer Report: Showed top buyers and customer counts by category.

## ✅ Final Words
This project is a simple and complete example of how SQL can help a business. It includes setting up a database, cleaning the data, asking smart questions, and making reports to help companies make better decisions.
